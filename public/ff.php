        <h1>FREE FIRE </h1>
        <h2>ABOUT FREE FIRE (GARENA) GLOBAL</h2>
      <p>Free Fire consists of up to 50 players. Players are free to choose their starting positions, buy weapons and supplies to extend their lives. When players join a game, they are in a plane flying over the island. While the plane is flying over the island, players can jump anywhere they want. So they can get away from the enemies and choose a strategic place. After landing, players should look for weapons and items that may be useful. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades and other items can be found all over the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; This requires players to eliminate all opponents they encounter along the way and make sure they are the only survivors. The available safe area of the game's map shrinks over time, and the map guides surviving players into tighter places to force their encounter. The last surviving player or team wins the round.</p>
